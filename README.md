# Helper files to customize scheduler

Here, you'll find some files used to some basic work and customization of kubernetes scheduler


We have pod descriptions for using the scheduler with:

* labeling: `with-label.yml`
* host name: `with-name.yml`
* random: `random.yml`
* requesting resources: `random_res.yml`

And other stuff. To find some other details, check on this [presentation] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12FkJ_yBIa4ACBJeSmaYk3O9XOpVZ2RI6XdC7rtIfLhM)
